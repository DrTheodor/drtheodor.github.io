Why? I don't know, i need to post my rants somewhere (preferably unmoderated).
I will post stuff in the blog occasionally. But I'll also cover like the last 2 years of fun stuff on The Grid SMP and my other experiences.

# The topics I will cover: 
- bytecode manipulation in Java (Java)
- Minecraft modding (Java)
- SpaceStation14 modding (C#) 
- & many more! (rants, Python, C++)
